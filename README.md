This project has been far more challenging than I initially anticipated, especially since I had to tackle most of the key concepts by searching outside of the provided lecture notes. 
I tried to check lecture notes but that wasn't enough for me to understand the topic so i had to watch courses and website notes. I wasted more time on learning stuff than coding the objective.

First one was easy but the second one was harder than i thought. I did so many approach but most of them failed, either giving bugs or not giving the output i expected. I started to build 2nd project step by step unlike on first css(which i made with almost single attempt)
I uploaded my every succesful step on github about 2nd css file. You can check each step from my commits.
